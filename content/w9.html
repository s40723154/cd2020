<p>Create a Better Product With Design Collaboration — Mindset, Tools, Process</p>
<p>Shaun Moynihan</p>
<p>Jul 10, 2019</p>
<p>Digital products are more complex today than ever before. Creating them requires multiple team</p>
<p>members, each with their own set of skills and expertise. At Savvy, for example, our customers</p>
<p>work closely with: a product manager, UX designer, visual designer, developer(s), content</p>
<p>strategist, and a growth specialist.</p>
<p>We use design collaboration to handle this complexity. Done right, design collaboration empowers</p>
<p>each of those experts with the mindset, process, and tools to come together and build a better</p>
<p>product faster.</p>
<p>We wrote this resource to help other app creators adopt a collaboration culture and process. Read</p>
<p>on to learn why design collaboration is important for creating compelling products and</p>
<p>experiences. We'll also dive into the elements of a design collaboration mindset and culture, tools</p>
<p>for effective design collaboration, and a real-world example of design collaboration at work.</p>
<p>What is "Design" Collaboration?</p>
<p>Before we jump into it, we need to get on the same page about what design collaboration is... and</p>
<p>is not. At its simplest, design collaboration is collaboration in a design-first environment. But,</p>
<p>because of the nature of design, especially the design we do at Savvy, design collaboration tends</p>
<p>to go beyond what people normally think of as collaboration.</p>
<p>While collaboration is generally defined as two or more people working together on the same task</p>
<p>towards a common goal, design collaboration involves much more.</p>
<p>Design collaboration includes more people with different skillsets, tougher challenges, and bigger</p>
<p>goals with farther-reaching impacts.</p>
<p>You might think of collaboration as two people hanging a piece of art. It simply requires</p>
<p>communication, teamwork, and four hands. Design collaboration is when a team of curators</p>
<p>carefully design a visitor's experience. They select the art, choose where and how to hang it, which</p>
<p>room it lives in (and the room's lighting, furniture), even the preceding rooms and the building as</p>
<p>a whole.</p>
<p>Why Design Collaboration is Important</p>
<p>You can design a product without collaboration, but it takes a collaborative design process to make</p>
<p>that product great. That's why design collaboration is so fundamental.</p>
<p>We don't just build apps for our customers. Savvy builds multi-platform experiences, complex</p>
<p>internal systems, and in some cases, entire brands and businesses. To do so, we leverage expertise</p>
<p>across several core disciplines: strategy, design, development, and growth. Each project involves</p>
<p>many people, each with their own skillsets and specialties.</p>
<p>Design collaboration puts those minds together, combining their separate, specialized expertise to</p>
<p>create solutions that tackle all aspects of a shared goal. Instead of coming at a problem from one</p>
<p>angle, design collaboration places that problem in front of all experts, forcing them to consider new</p>
<p>perspectives and possibilities.</p>
<p>For example, we involve our developers early on in the design process to make sure we're</p>
<p>accounting for technical opportunities and limitations as soon as possible. This allows us to take</p>

<p>advantage of and push our technical capabilities while eliminating costly roadblocks further in the</p>
<p>process. It also limits how much a single person can work in a silo, keeping the work in the open</p>
<p>and the emphasis on the user needs and product goals.</p>
<p>Cultivating a Design Collaboration Mindset</p>
<p>The right mindset goes a long way in establishing effective collaboration in the design process. It</p>
<p>lays the guidelines for who collaborates, how, and to what end.</p>
<p>COLLABORATION IS FOR EVERYONE</p>
<p>Designers sometimes think that people who are not designers are not qualified to give good</p>
<p>feedback. But great design is more than visuals. It encompasses everything about a product, from</p>
<p>its branding to its engineering to its growth.</p>
<p>Design collaboration brings in many people, each with their own perspectives and strengths. It</p>
<p>gives everyone a voice. These fresh perspectives give designers more information. Perspectives</p>
<p>equip designers to make the right decisions on choices that have lasting impacts on other design,</p>
<p>development, and marketing options down the road.</p>
<p>Collaboration with customers is as important as collaboration with other designers and team</p>
<p>members. At Savvy, we keep our customer involved throughout the creation of their product. We</p>
<p>take our time to explain options and have discussions with the customer to make sure we</p>
<p>understand their thoughts.</p>
<p>This enables us to get buy-in from customers early on and work from clear beginnings and ends.</p>
<p>Larger reveals aren't big surprises, and no one gets to the point where they're seeing work for the</p>
<p>first time.</p>
<p>Customer collaboration means arriving at a more defined product sooner, without costly</p>
<p>back-stepping and unnecessary meetings.</p>
<p>It's easy to get caught up in your role and ignore the big picture. By involving more people earlier</p>
<p>on, you're fostering closer connections with teammates and cultivating a shared responsibility and</p>
<p>interest in the success of the product. You're creating a more open and transparent process, as</p>
<p>well a more connected and invested team.</p>
<p>COLLABORATION IS CONTEXTUAL</p>
<p>Customers come to us with complex challenges and goals. Not to mention, we continue to work</p>
<p>with our customers for months, even years, and accumulate vast tomes of knowledge on past</p>
<p>decisions, research, and other valuable context.</p>
<p>By adopting a context-first approach, you can make sure everyone is at the highest level of</p>
<p>knowledge. This enables them to make the most informed decisions as they work on the product.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we keep everyone at Savvy updated on relevant information by bringing in all</p>
<p>team members early, documenting and recording meetings, establishing some overlap, and treating</p>
<p>the next team member in the process like a customer.</p>
<p>Context is just as important on a case-by-case collaborative basis. Follow these guidelines to keep</p>
<p>context first in collaboration:</p>
<p>Provide context before showing your work. Chances are if your work is on the screen while you're</p>
<p>giving context, you've lost your audience's attention.</p>
<p>Describe the problem you're trying to solve or goal you're trying to achieve.</p>
<p>I:\DesignCollaborationBetterProducts.txt -- File date: 2/29/2020 -- File time: 4:02:48 PM</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DesignCollaborationBetterProducts.txt -- Printed on 2/29/2020, 4:04:22 PM -- Page 3</p>
<p>Present your work as it relates to the problem at hand. Explain your thinking and why you made</p>
<p>certain decisions.</p>
<p>Be specific about what you want feedback on.</p>
<p>COLLABORATION IS OPEN, HONEST, AND FEARLESS</p>
<p>It isn't easy to put your work (and yourself) out there. Emotions can get in the way of providing</p>
<p>open and honest feedback, especially when you're worried about hurting the other person's feelings.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there's no place for emotion in collaboration. How something makes you feel is</p>
<p>important in design. We think of and create solutions for people... people who are emotional, and</p>
<p>who use emotions in their decisions. Leaving emotion out of the conversation might short-change a</p>
<p>potential idea or solution. At best, having only a pragmatic discussion around facts and data won't</p>
<p>provide the full picture. At worst, it may be a red herring or provide a false narrative.</p>
<p>At Savvy, we empower our team to be "fearless" about receiving feedback. This means letting go</p>
<p>of any anxieties about being judged for what we create. It also means understanding that we are</p>
<p>stronger together and stand a greater chance of creating something great. In being fearless, we</p>
<p>better trust and empower each other to give honest and thoughtful feedback.</p>
<p>Our team also believes in being fearless about providing feedback. This means understanding the</p>
<p>problem that needs solving as well as the customer's brand and goals. It also means asking lots of</p>
<p>questions either to uncover relevant thoughts or to help guide decisions.</p>
<p>Try presenting feedback in an exploratory and guiding manner, with the intent of building up and</p>
<p>improving the work rather than tearing it down.</p>
<p>Tweet This</p>
<p>Your feedback should be constructive. Instead of saying you don't like something, frame your</p>
<p>feedback to point back to the problem you're trying to help solve. Provide actionable steps on</p>
<p>improving the work or at the very least the reasoning behind your thinking. And don't forget to</p>
<p>express what you like and why.</p>
<p>COLLABORATION IS MORE THAN NEW IDEAS</p>
<p>It's one thing to be open and accepting of collaborative feedback, another to parse those thoughts</p>
<p>and use them as catalysts to spark your own. This is a more advanced skill that develops over</p>
<p>time. One way to practice this is to become a better listener.</p>
<p>Often, during a conversation with others, we think more about what we are going to say next rather</p>
<p>than what others are saying. This impacts the feedback process, especially in design, because we</p>
<p>often know what we want to say before hearing another opinion or solution.</p>
<p>When you choose to listen first and react second, it allows you to fully understand the feedback</p>
<p>someone else is presenting and sets you up to go deeper — what is the perspective they're using</p>
<p>and the place they're coming from? Chances are this is a perspective you didn't consider during the</p>
<p>creation process. By listening to and understanding the context and reasoning behind the feedback</p>
<p>you're receiving, you're opening yourself to more ways of looking at, thinking of, and experiencing</p>
<p>your design. You can then test these new perspectives against the challenges, goals, and use cases</p>
<p>you're designing for to see if they better suit the user.</p>
<p>It's easier to be more receptive of feedback when all collaborators practice active listening.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the skill of giving great feedback comes from learning how to receive it. As we make an</p>
<p>effort to be better listeners, we also find ourselves becoming more humble and, in our opinion,</p>

<p>better designers.</p>
<p>Finding and Using the Right Design Collaboration Tools</p>
<p>The right tools go a long way in reinforcing your team's design collaboration mindset. In this</p>
<p>section, you'll learn what to look for in collaboration tools. We also recommend tools based on our</p>
<p>own experiences.</p>
<p>SELECTING THE RIGHT TOOLS</p>
<p>Effective collaboration tools remove all barriers for collaborators to quickly and easily access and</p>
<p>interact with the work. This keeps the focus on giving feedback. They also allow others to</p>
<p>collaborate on a design without destroying the original.</p>
<p>In the past, we used relied on tools that provided basic versioning control instead of true</p>
<p>collaborative features. For example, a designer would save a Sketch file and upload it to Dropbox.</p>
<p>Another team member would then download it, work on it, and re-upload it. There was no easy way</p>
<p>to make changes while the file was in another's hands. We tried something similar with Github, a</p>
<p>tool that proved great for managing codebases, but not so much with iterative design work.</p>
<p>Needless to say, these version control processes made our collaboration more time consuming,</p>
<p>confusing, and very un-collaborative.</p>
<p>Now we choose from a variety of more advanced tools depending on the type of collaboration we</p>
<p>want to achieve.</p>
<p>FIGMA</p>
<p>This is a collaboration-first, shared workspace tool. Figma works well for having multiple people in</p>
<p>same area of the design file. You can watch teammates design or work together on the same design</p>
<p>in real time.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>Figma reduces the ability for someone to work in a silo.</p>
<p>There's no need to add unnecessary polish or create static deliverables to enable collaboration. So</p>
<p>you don't need to change your workflow to show off a design.</p>
<p>It's easy to see and interact with the work in its native environment and apply tweaks at will.</p>
<p>When to use: Flow docs, high-fidelity wireframes, spur-of-the-moment collaboration, and walking</p>
<p>customers through a series of screens to explain and get feedback on design direction.</p>
<p>MARVEL</p>
<p>While Figma tends to feel more free-form and flexible, Marvel allows for a more standardized form</p>
<p>of collaboration. It also makes it easy on our customers to collaborate with us.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>Marvel is a cleaner, more formalized and focused space, great for collaborating with non-design</p>
<p>team members.</p>
<p>It removes all need for the customer to pay for an account or have a deep understanding of the tool</p>
<p>to see the work.</p>

<p>Customers can download screens and see them in action on a device environment via the Marvel</p>
<p>app.</p>
<p>When to use: Presenting more finalized design work with customers and developers. (Learn about</p>
<p>how Marvel compares with other prototyping tools.)</p>
<p>OTHER COLLABORATION TOOLS</p>
<p>Zeplin is a useful hand-off tool that allows developers to dive into the nitty gritty specs of design</p>
<p>work. (We talk more in-depth about Zeplin here.)</p>
<p>Quip is a great platform for brainstorming and product/process documentation. We use it to record</p>
<p>and organize all of the context and knowledge that team members need to know when working on</p>
<p>a project. It's also useful for brainstorming new ideas that aren't visual-focused.</p>
<p>Please note that there are many other tools out there that add similar benefits to collaboration as</p>
<p>the ones listed above. This list represents the tools that have worked well for us in our day-to-day</p>
<p>collaboration and is not indicative of all the options that might work well for your team.</p>
<p>Savvy's Design Collaboration Process in Practice</p>
<p>Now let's take the best practices and tools outlined above and show how they fit together in a</p>
<p>real-life situation. We'll use the live drawing experience in the Press Play app to demonstrate the</p>
<p>importance of design collaboration. This experience involved significant collaboration from a</p>
<p>number of team members across disciplines, including a visual designer, UX designer, developer,</p>
<p>product manager, and of course, the customer.</p>
<p>THE CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE</p>
<p>Press Play is a sweepstakes app that holds daily, weekly, and monthly drawings. Users earn tickets</p>
<p>by watching ads and enter drawings by selecting five emojis. Winners are then rewarded based on</p>
<p>how their choices match up with the drawing's randomly-selected emojis. This particular task had</p>
<p>us creating a fun and exciting live experience for users awaiting the results of the live drawing.</p>
<p>It was important for us to create a game-like animation for this experience. We especially wanted</p>
<p>to evoke a sense of playfulness and anticipation on the screen where users go to see how their</p>
<p>chosen emojis match up with those from the sweepstakes drawing.</p>
<p>That said, we needed to be mindful of the level of complexity an animation requires and its impact</p>
<p>on the overall product's timeline and cost. Our goal was to push the level of fidelity within a</p>
<p>reasonable time without significantly impacting the project's budget.</p>
<p>THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS</p>
<p>Stage 1: Wireframes and Brainstorming</p>
<p>First, a Savvy UX designer created Press Play's overall UX and wireframes, determining what</p>
<p>screens were needed and the timing for each one. She also put together a rough concept (shown</p>
<p>right) for the live drawing animation, expressing initial ideas based on customer's needs and the</p>
<p>project's established UX.</p>
<p>She presented the wireframes and the rough animation to the product manager and visual</p>
<p>designer. Then all three met with the customer so everyone would hear the feedback directly.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Research and Context</p>
<p>I:\DesignCollaborationBetterProducts.txt -- File date: 2/29/2020 -- File time: 4:02:48 PM</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DesignCollaborationBetterProducts.txt -- Printed on 2/29/2020, 4:04:22 PM -- Page 6</p>
<p>The Savvy visual designer tasked with creating the actual live drawing animation came in with</p>
<p>fresh eyes and without much prior knowledge of the Press Play product. To get up to speed, he</p>
<p>talked in depth with the UX designer and product manager. He also dedicated additional research</p>
<p>time to understand the overall product goals, challenges, and to familiarize himself with the work</p>
<p>to date. As mentioned earlier, he was part of the wireframe presentation and present for the</p>
<p>customer's feedback.</p>
<p>With that context, he conducted some additional research more directly related to the task at hand.</p>
<p>In doing so, he made sure he understood the live drawing experience requirements, goals, and</p>
<p>challenges. He looked at other apps with similar experiences and fidelity and referenced the rough</p>
<p>animation to know what exactly the final animation needed to show (in this case, the winning</p>
<p>emojis and the user's emoji selections). Before getting too tied to a solution, he met with a Savvy</p>
<p>iOS developer to understand technical constraints and considerations.</p>
<p>Our visual designer and UX designer then brainstormed what was important for the visuals. They</p>
<p>agreed that there needed to be a slow reveal to build up suspense/anticipation for the user</p>
<p>Stage 3: Iteration and Feedback</p>
<p>As our visual designer worked through a number of different directions he tapped the UX designer</p>
<p>to chat through his progress and designs in Figma. By talking through the work they spurred more</p>
<p>ideas and iterations while making sure they were staying true to customer expectations. With more</p>
<p>solid options at hand, he met once again with the iOS developer to make sure everything was in</p>
<p>line from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>Stage 4: Customer Feedback and Development</p>
<p>When we landed on several, more finalized versions of the experience, the visual designer walked</p>
<p>through them with the customer using Figma. The product manager and UX designer for Press Play</p>
<p>provided feedback and guidance as well.</p>
<p>Once they all learned what piqued the customer's interest, the visual designer set off to maximize</p>
<p>the visuals and make them ready for development. He continued to work with the iOS developer to</p>
<p>get the most out of the concept on a technical level.</p>
<p>THE END RESULT</p>
<p>Press Play's live drawing animation is an example of design collaboration at work; a team of</p>
<p>cross-discipline experts working together to solve a design and development challenge with bigger</p>
<p>implications. Without design collaboration, we wouldn't have discovered the ideal intersection of</p>
<p>user experience, visual, and technical.</p>
<p>When the customer saw the animation alive in his app he called it "groundbreaking."</p>
<p>What’s more, the research, collaboration, and creation of this Press Play experience helped us</p>
<p>discover a gap in the product’s user journey. Originally, the live drawing’s intent was to be a fun</p>
<p>way to show the results to users. As we moved through the design process, we realized that if a</p>
<p>user doesn’t watch the live drawing, and they lose, they don’t get to experience an end to their</p>
<p>user journey for that drawing.</p>
<p>From that discovery, we decided to improve the app in a couple of other places as well. We added a</p>
<p>results/live drawing element to the Winner’s Circle and a win-lose history section to the User</p>
<p>Details side of the app. In the end, design collaboration empowered us to realize this unfulfilled</p>
<p>need in the user experience.</p>

<p>It takes design collaboration to tackle the complex, crucial problems that come along with building</p>
<p>great products and experiences. By leveraging the specialized expertise of multiple team members</p>
<p>across disciplines, design collaboration makes sure teams meet challenges from all perspectives</p>
<p>and come to better solutions. With the right mindset, tools, and process, design collaboration</p>
<p>empowers teams to go deeper with creative thinking and iteration.</p>
<p>We hope this guide gives you a good foundation from which you can build your own effective design</p>
<p>collaboration process. You can learn more about design and product strategy on the Savvy blog,</p>

<p>通過設計協作創建更好的產品-心態，工具，過程</p>
<p>肖恩·莫尼漢（Shaun Moynihan）</p>
<p>2019年7月10日</p>
<p>今天，數字產品比以往任何時候都更加複雜。創建它們需要多個團隊</p>
<p>成員，每個成員都有自己的一套技能和專業知識。例如，在Savvy，我們的客戶</p>
<p>與以下人員緊密合作：產品經理，用戶體驗設計師，視覺設計師，開發人員，內容戰略家和成長專家。</p>
<p>我們使用設計協作來處理這種複雜性。正確完成，設計協作可助力</p>
<p>每個專家都有共同的心態，流程和工具，以建立更好的產品。</p>
<p>我們編寫了此資源，以幫助其他應用程序創建者採用協作文化和流程。讀</p>
<p>繼續學習為什麼設計協作對於創造引人注目的產品很重要，以及</p>
<p>經驗。我們還將深入探討設計協作心態和文化，工具的要素</p>
<p>進行有效的設計協作，以及實際工作中的設計協作示例。</p>
<p><strong>什麼是“設計”協作？</strong></p>
<p>在進入之前，我們需要在同一頁面上了解什麼是設計協作。簡單來說，<span style="color: #ff0000;">設計協作就是在設計優先的環境中進行協作。</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">通常將協作定義為兩個或兩個以上的人共同完成一項任務</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">為了實現一個共同的目標，設計協作涉及更多。</span></p>
<p>設計協作包括更多具有不同技能，艱鉅挑戰和更大規模的人員</p>
<p>具有深遠影響的目標。</p>
<p>您可能將協作視為兩個人掛在一塊藝術品上。它只需要</p>
<p>溝通，團隊合作和四隻手。設計協作是指一組策展人</p>
<p>精心設計訪問者的體驗。他們選擇藝術品，選擇在何處以及如何懸掛藝術品，</p>
<p>它所居住的房間（以及房間的照明，家具），甚至前面的房間和整個建築物</p>
<p>為什麼設計協作很重要</p>
<p>您可以設計產品而無需協作，但是需要一個協作設計過程才能完成</p>
<p>該產品很棒。這就是設計協作如此重要的原因。</p>
<p>我們不僅為客戶構建應用程序。精明構建複雜的多平台體驗</p>
<p>內部系統，在某些情況下還包括整個品牌和業務。為此，我們利用專業知識</p>
<p>涵蓋多個核心學科：戰略，設計，開發和增長。每個項目都涉及</p>
<p>許多人都有各自的技能和專長。</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">設計協作將這些思想融合在一起，將他們各自的專業知識結合在一起</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">創建解決方案，以解決共同目標的所有方面。而不是一個人遇到問題</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">角度來看，設計協作將這個問題擺在所有專家面前，迫使他們考慮新</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">觀點和可能性。</span></p>
<p>例如，我們在設計過程的早期就讓我們的開發人員參與進來，以確保我們</p>
<p>盡快解決技術機會和局限性。這使我們可以</p>
<p> </p>
<p>優勢並推動我們的技術能力，同時進一步消除了昂貴的障礙</p>
<p>處理。它還限制了一個人可以在筒倉中工作的數量，從而使工作保持公開狀態</p>
<p>並強調用戶需求和產品目標。</p>
<p><strong>培養設計協作心態</strong></p>
<p>在設計過程中建立有效的協作，正確的思維方式將大有幫助。它</p>
<p>為誰進行協作，如何合作以及達到何種目的奠定了指導方針。</p>
<p><strong>合作適合每個人</strong></p>
<p>設計師有時會認為不是設計師的人沒有資格提供良好的產品</p>
<p>反饋。但是出色的設計不只是視覺效果。它涵蓋了有關產品的所有內容，從</p>
<p>其品牌，其工程技術以使其成長。</p>
<p>設計協作吸引了許多人，每個人都有自己的觀點和優勢。它</p>
<p>給大家一個聲音。這些新鮮的觀點為設計師提供了更多信息。觀點</p>
<p>使設計師能夠對對其他設計產生持久影響的選擇做出正確的決定，</p>
<p>開發和營銷選擇。</p>
<p>與客戶的協作與與其他設計師和團隊的協作一樣重要</p>
<p>成員。在Savvy，我們讓客戶參與其產品的整個創作過程。我們</p>
<p>花些時間來解釋選項，並與客戶進行討論以確保我們了解他們的想法。</p>
<p>這使我們能夠及早獲得客戶的認可，並從明確的起點和終點開始工作。</p>
<p>與客戶的合作意味著無需花錢就可以更快地獲得更清晰的產品後台</p>
